## How does it work?
### Proposal Process

A researcher submits a proposal to donors, who then vote on its approval within a specified time frame (e.g. 24 hours). If the proposal meets or exceeds the required threshold before the deadline, an approver steps in to finalize the decision and enable fund transfer to the researcher.

### Donor Participation

Donors can contribute USDC to a shared pool, earning a Governance Token for each dollar staked (1:1 ratio).
As a token holder, donors gain voting power on proposals, with the option to influence the outcome.
When a proposal reaches the required threshold within the specified time frame, it is presented to an approver for final review and approval.

### Approver Role

Approvers play a critical role in validating proposals and ensuring funds are allocated responsibly. They review approved proposals and facilitate the transfer of funds to researchers after exercising their discretion to approve the proposal.
